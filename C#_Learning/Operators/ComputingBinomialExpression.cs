/*
Problem Statement 
Write code for computing the formula

(a+b)^2
which expands into the following expression:

widget

In your code:

Compute squares of double type variables a and b.
Compute the product 2*a*b
Then Add the squares and the product together.
â€‹Use Math.Pow library to compute the squares of tha variables a and b.
Example 
Input:

a = 2.4;
b = 4.5;
